        <h2>A Rough Release</h2>
        <p>No Man's Sky is a sore spot for many people in the gaming circle. The plans for this game were incredibly ambitious, and the anticipation for its release ballooned during its production. People were so passionate about this game that the developers received death threats when they delayed its release.  The developers promised many things, online play, fleet battles, complex creatures, and many more. However, the game they released had almost none of these far out promises. The ensuing outrage from the release caused mass outrage, and, of course, horrible reviews. Literally less than 1 in 5 reviews of this game were positive. It smashed records of most refunded game on Steam almost immediately. However, no matter how angry everyone was, I just couldn't bring myself to return it. To me, the game had charm, and endless potential. So here is a few reasons why I love No Man's Sky, and why you should too.

        <h2>The Visuals</h2>
        <p>The picture to the right, as well as all the other pictures shown hereafter, were taken in the game, with the game's screenshot function. While people argued about the games holes in content, I never found a single person complain of this game's picturesqueness. The incredible depth that exists between worlds is amazing, and there's nothing more satisfying than finding an awesome sunset on a planet with 5 moons. Every planet has something that makes it unique, and special. The planet in this photo is mostly ocean, but the creatures on this planet are very aggressive for some reason. This makes this planet tough to explore, as you can only run so far on an island. I've seen planets that have a pink sky, pink ground, and pink wildlife, as well as a world with strange, tentacle-like rock formations scattered across the land. The photos you'll see here are just a fraction of the amazing sights I've seen on my journey.

        <h2>The Adventures</h2>
        <p> As you'll see further on, there are two different ships in these pictures. This is because I switched part way through. The first ship, which name I have forgotten, I found completely by random chance, crashed on an extremely hot planet. During the day, the surface temperatures exceeded 300 C, and I abandoned my old ship to pick this new one. I spent 3 days on that hellish planet, gathering supplies to fix the ships faulty launch thrusters. I never forgot how hard it was to get that thing moving, but it was worth it. As for the new ship, called the Nowadach S55, I followed a distress beacon to its location and fixed it. Its cargo capacity has allowed me to make some hefty profits in the intergalactic trade market. I have many memoreable moments that this game has created, many of which sound like they jumped right out of a science-fiction novel. Getting stranded on a distant moon and using your wit to get back into space, finding an ancient alien artifact, finding the ravaged remains of what used to be an outpost, the list truly goes on.

          <h2>The Gameplay</h2>
          <p> This game allows you to customize your technology very well. For example, my old ship used an amped up mining beam to fight off pirates, I chose it over conventional guns because of the laser's lack of travel time. As for my current ship, the Nowadach, it has a similar weapon, although I have devoted much more power to its warp drive. I have effectively tripled the distant I can go in a single warp, allowing me to find the best deals in a 1500 lightyear radius! With my specialized economy scanner, I can read the economical prosperity of a system before I travel to it, allowing me to find an area that both has a high demand for what I'm selling, as well as a large supply of something that is in high demand somewhere else. Armed with a powerful warp drive and advanced scanner, I can sniff out the perfect deals, and have currently increased my profit margin to about 2 million units per trade!

            <h2>The Updates</h2>
            <p> Ever since its somewhat turbulent release, the developers have been adding new content to the game. Now you can build bases and settle down, or even get a freighter for huge trade deals, if you can swing the multi-million credit price tag. Or, you can now complete missions for certain factions in space, handing in bounties, fixing a component on a nearby planet, or helping the front on destroying the dreaded Sentinel menace. Or, with the addition of many rare blueprints, you can search the universe for recipes for valuable raw materials, so you can manufacture them and sell them for a sweet paycheck. You can even satisfy your yearning for carnage by raiding freighters for the cargo they carry. But none of these compare to the most important upcoming feature: being able to experience all of this with friends, online! </p>

            <h2>Finale</h2>
            <p> This is a shot of my home planet, Oishirishir. It's a beautiful planet, with endless fields of green and a healthy climate. As long as you avoid the hordes of killer robots that roam its surface, you will love it there. I hope I've been able to convince you that this game is worth playing. I felt that this game was so surrounded with negativity, I wanted to be a voice of reason amongst the mob. Thank you for reading this, I hope you enjoyed it. </p>
